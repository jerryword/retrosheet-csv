Somewhere there was also an error on the Tiger thirdbaseman without the ball being put into play.  I lumped both advancements and the E5 together to account for everything.  This one may require more research. Tiger catcher Bill Freehan is credited by the Twins scorer with an assist although it can't be found anywhere on the scoresheet.  The CS3(2E5) would account for it . . . Changed to OA - Versalles was not CS in game.","1965DET.EVA.regular.comment.csv",37

If Quilici was NOT a pinch runner, then the putout COULD have been on Valdespino being caught in a rundown following his single. i.e. S8.2-H;BX2(263)? This is my best guess as to what happened . . .
