"DET196505270",0,"Temperature dropped to 54 by the 9th inning."
"DET196506111",45,"The scorer says that Versalles scored on Hall's single and Valdespino scored from second on an 'FC'.  Hall is only credited with one RBI on the play.  I'm guessing that the 'FC' was on either Oliva or Hall on a cutoff throw to the infield.  All the runners were safe and Valdespino scored."
"DET196506111",72,"No details are given about this play other than Mincher scored and Kindall went to second on an error by Terry Fox. The error didn't occur on a hit ball, so I guessed it was some sort of pickoff attempt."

"DET196508170",4,"Unclear as to what happened here.  The Twins scorer provides no details at all; the Tigers scorer seems to indicate that Oliva advanced on Allison's strikeout.  Somewhere there was also an error on the Tiger thirdbaseman without the ball being put into play.  I lumped both advancements and the E5 together to account for everything.  This one may require more research. Tiger catcher Bill Freehan is credited by the Twins scorer with an assist although it can't be found anywhere on the scoresheet.  The CS3(2E5) would account for it . . . Changed to OA - Versalles was not CS in game."

"DET196508192",57,"It's unclear as to how this play actually happened.  The Detroit scorer has a notation that may indicate Quilici as a pinch runner.  Quilici certainly came in as a defensive replacement in the bottom of the inning.  If Quilici was NOT a pinch runner, then the putout COULD have been on Valdespino being caught in a rundown following his single. i.e. S8.2-H;BX2(263)? This is my best guess as to what happened . . . Quilici was not a PR, so we go with plan B"
