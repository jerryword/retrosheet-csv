Play was suspended several minutes during the argument, and resulted in the ejection of Sisler & P.Collins. Police were called in when fans resorted to a pop bottle shower.  Jimmie Austin and Holmes went thru all the gesture of a fistic melee, but no blows were struck; Austin was ejected In the near-riot that followed, fans tore down a RF gate; Sisler persuaded them to remain in the stands.  Phil Ball, accompanied by police, confronted Ump Rowland at 3B and a long heated discussion took place.  This caused the fans to throw more pop bottles at Holmes over the Browns' protests. Afterward Sisler aided in the repair of the fallen gate.  As he ran back to the plate he was given a big hand, then he engaged in another verbal combat with Holmes.  Play was finally resumed after a 15-minute delay.","1924SLA.EVA.regular.comment.csv",202
