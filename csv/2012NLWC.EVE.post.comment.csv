"ATL201210050",67,"$SS Peter Kozma ran out into shallow LF and stopped under the fly ball; when he turned and put his hands out to call off LF Matt Holliday, LF umpire Sam Holbrook called it an infield fly; the signal was repeated by 3B umpire Jeff Nelson; Kozma then moved away and the ball dropped onto the field; when the Braves realized that Simmons was out, manager Fredi Gonzalez ran out to argue with Holbrook; fans started throwing trash onto the field, some of it in the direction of the umpires; the Carinals left the field while a crew picked up the debris; the Braves protested the ruling, which was denied shortly after the game concluded, based on the fact that an infield fly is a judgment call and not subject to a protest; the delay lasted 19 minutes"2012NLWC.EVE.post.comment.csv",6
