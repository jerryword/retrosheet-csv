"KC1196505140",12,"Hit location unclear"
"KC1196505140",15,"I have no idea what happened here!  The Minnesota scorer says that Charles reached on a fielder's choice and was then put out 1-5-3.  The KC scorer says that the play was 1-3-4. Also, the Minnesota scorer credits Rich Rollins with an E5 during the inning and the KC scorer doesn't mention it at all!  My vision: grounder to the mound, Kaat throws to Rollins who errs allowing Hawk Harrelson to reach third. from second.  Rollins recovers and alertly throws across the diamond to get Ed Charles who has rounded first and maybe even headed for second.  Would the proper notation in that case be '1E5'instead of just 'E5'?"
"KC1196505140",15,"Kostro came in defensively here... perhaps Rollins was hurt on previous play"

"KC1196505140",21,"The first ball hit to Frank Kostro in his first appearance at third base this season . . ."

"KC1196505140",35,"Not sure why this wasn't ruled a GDP"
"KC1196505140",72,"Hit location unclear"
"KC1196505140",75,"It looks like Boswell held third on the double play.  He eventually scores on a wild pitch.  The timing of the WP is unclear except that it happened after Versalles' single and before Oliva's double.  If the WP had occurred before the DP then Versalles would have held first on the play while Boswell scored (unlikely).  It's more likely that Boswell made a mental error and held third on a GDP and THEN scored on the WP."
"KC1196505150",1,"Debut game for Don Buschhorn"

"KC1196505162",5,"Hit location unclear"
"KC1196505162",30,"The Minnesota scorer scores a fly to center, the KC scorer says it was a fly to left?"
"KC1196505162",62,"This is my best guess as to what happened!  It's possible that the A's tried a double steal (perhaps delayed) of second and home.  One way of defending against such a play is for the catcher to throw to toward second, but actually intend for the pitcher to cut the throw and catch the runner from third.  If that's what happened, then Klippstein botched the cutoff or his throw back to the plate trying to get Campaneris."
"KC1196505162",75,"Another 'best guess' as to what occurred! DWS: must separate with APO Originally one play"
