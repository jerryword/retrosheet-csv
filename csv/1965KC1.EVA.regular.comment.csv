Also, the Minnesota scorer credits Rich Rollins with an E5 during the inning and the KC scorer doesn't mention it at all!  My vision: grounder to the mound, Kaat throws to Rollins who errs allowing Hawk Harrelson to reach third. from second.  Rollins recovers and alertly throws across the diamond to get Ed Charles who has rounded first and maybe even headed for second.
