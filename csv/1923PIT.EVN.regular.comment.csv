"PIT192305250",16,"$With Grimm on 1B, Rawlings singled, sending Grimm to 2B. It was after the single that the Cardinals detected Grimm had batted out of turn, and he was called out under the rule by Ump Klem.  Not sure what the official scoring was, but Rawlings remained at 1B. The official batting order given Capt Shotten before the game had Rawlings batting ahead of Grimm. 'The rule covering the case stated that the transgression must be called to the attention of the umpire before the ball is delivered to the succeeding batsman. In the case at Forbes Field, Rawlings had batted before Grimm was called out. Skipper McKechnie notified Klem of his intention to protest the game, but fortunately, the Bucs precluded this move by winning in the interesting way.'","1923PIT.EVN.regular.comment.csv",4
