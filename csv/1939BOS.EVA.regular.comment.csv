"BOS193909032",68,"$Per NY Times eighth inning started with singles by Keller and Joe D. off new pitcher Joe Heving.  Dickey walked to fill the bases. Selkirk forced Keller at plate and C Peacock threw to 1B for DP but Foxx dropped the throw and Joe scored.  Gordon then doubled Dickey in. Boston manager Cronin saw only 10 minutes to 6:30 PM Sunday curfew. So with Selkirk on 3B and Gordon on 2B Cronin ordered Dahlgren intentionally walked.  Dahlgren swung at ball one and Selkirk ran home to be tagged out by Peacock for out 2 as Gordon took 3B. HP ump Hubbard warned Dahlgren not to swing at intentional balls. Dahlgren took the next wide pitch and Gordon ran home  to be tagged out by Peacock for third out. Cronin ran to Hubbard and argued vigorously as fans showered field with straw hats and pop bottles. With only few minutes till curfew there was no time to clear field and finish the inning, Hubbard forfeited the game to Yankees. Cronin protested the game. Cronin argued the Yankees had played unfairly by running into outs at plate and tried to interfere with a perfectly legal intentional walk by having the batter swing at wide pitches.  The Yankees left Boston to make their Monday double header in Philadelphia while Boston hosted Senators for 2.  The AL President Harridge upheld the protest per NY Times of 9/9/39, rolled the game back to end of seventh, declared game a tie that would be replayed in Boston as  part of a DH 9/26, and fined Dahlgren, Gordon, and Selkirk each $100 for 'reprehensible conduct.' Yankees filed an appeal with Harridge. Rain washed out the two-day Yankee trip to Boston 9/26-27 so the game never was replayed."1939BOS.EVA.regular.comment.csv",184
