"DET193208010",9,"$The original lineup card submitted by Yankee manager McCarthy listed Ben Chapman 5th and Lazzeri 6th. When Lazzeri came out to bat, McCarthy came out to home plate and asked the umpire to switch Lazzeri and Chapman in the lineup. Umpire Nallin okayed this. After Lazzeri singled, Tigers manager Harris came out to object that Lazzeri batted out of turn. Nallin said that he allowed McCarthy to change his lineup, so Harris played the game under protest. The protest was upheld by AL President Will Harridge on August 12. Harridge ruled that Nallin had violated Rule 35. The statistics in this game were ruled official but the game was ruled a no-decision and was replayed.","1932DET.EVA.regular.comment.csv",36
