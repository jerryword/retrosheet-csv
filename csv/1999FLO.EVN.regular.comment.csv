"FLO199905310",46,"$Reviewed before replays were permitted; ball hit on or above the LF scoreboard and was first ruled a double by 2B umpire Greg Gibson; the Marlins argued the ball hit facade behind scoreboard and should be a homer; after conferring umpires led by crew chief Frank Pulli changed call to home run; Cards then argued, and Pulli, who later said he was confused by the ground rules, decided to look at replays shown on a TV camera; he changed the call back to a double; Marlins protested the game, but it was denied; Pulli was admonished by the NL President, and a specific directive was issued barring future replays; the play would have been eligible for review under the replay rules adopted in 2008","1999FLO.EVN.regular.comment.csv",7
