Angered by a continuing verbal attack by the fan in a box seat, Smith, who had just backed up the play at 1B, quickly climbed into the stands and struck the offender. 'That gent was on me all day.  He called me all sorts of names.  When I decided to go after him, I asked him to take off his glasses.  He took them off and I socked him in the  side of the neck.' Teammates ran to his assistance and a near riot ensued. Police and the umpires quelled the disturbance. As Smith neared the park exit, another irate rooter threw a chair that struck him, inflicting a gash on his forehead which required medical attention.  NY Times version: The trouble started when Smith ran toward the grandstand for a foul fly which he failed to catch.  He became embroiled in an argument with W.J. Lewis of Boston, a spectator.  They were preparing to 'mix' when onlookers said Smith struck the spectator a glancing blow.  Police and others intervened and Smith was ordered from the game as the crowd swarmed onto the field.  As he passed down the steps to the visiting team's quarters beneath the grandstand, a chair, thrown by an unidentified spectator, landed on top of him.  The police had difficulty for a time in handling the crowd. Boston Globe: The heckling of Smith began after he had run into Burrus at first base.  For this Smith was not to blame."
