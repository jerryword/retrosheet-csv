"CAL196505191",43,"Hit location unclear"
"CAL196505191",44,"It looks like Jose Cardenal was caught trying to advance from first to third following the groundout by Albie Pearson.  Hard to visualize, but it's the only way I can translate the scoresheet . . . Even weirder: ruled a GDP... maybe there was some strange shift"

"CAL196505192",7,"Clinton's entry into the game isn't clearly marked, but he didn't bat for Pearson in the first and he was in the game in the top of the third when he recorded the only right field putout of the game.  This seems like a logical place for the substitution; perhaps something happened to Pearson during his at-bat."

"CAL196506300",20,"The scoresheet says 6-3, but the game summary shows a 1-6-3 DP for the Twins instead.  I went with the 6-3 because the scorer went through the trouble of identifying the first out as a 6/U; the error could have come in the transcribing after the game. Pleis officially credited with DP... changed to 163"

"CAL196508202",68,"I'm not sure if this is a DP or GDP: Valdespino started on first base and advanced on the 5-3 groundout.  He was then caught trying for third base.  So, the DP is 5-3-5 . . ."
