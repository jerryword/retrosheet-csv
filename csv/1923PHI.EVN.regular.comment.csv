"PHI192305070",36,"During this AB, Stengel was convinced that Weinert had tried to bean him, hurled his bat at the pitcher, and rushed out of the box. In an instant both players were swinging at each other, while other players of both teams gathered around them and policemen poured out of the stands. Mgr Fletcher, aided by two policemen, dragged Stengel away from his opponent and Casey was escorted to the Giants' bench by three policemen.  Still full of fight, Stengel struggled against them in vain.  He and Weinert were ejected by Ump McCormick.  Shinners finished Stengel's AB with Bishop on the mound.","1923PHI.EVN.regular.comment.csv",4
