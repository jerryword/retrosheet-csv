"BOS196505260",51,"I'm not sure how this play happened or even exactly when it happened.  I do know that Kindall was put out at the plate 1-3-2 sometime AFTER Earley took over on the mound.  The scorer shows Kindall moving to third on Versalles' grounder leaving runners on first and third with two out.  The most likely scenario I can conjure up in my mind is that Kindall tried to steal home or advance on a pickoff attempt at first on Versalles.  This would yield the 1-3-2 . . .","1965BOS.EVA.regular.comment.csv",31

The last play in the top of the third was a caught stealing at second with Mantilla getting the putout.  Perhaps as a result of that play he had to leave the game.
