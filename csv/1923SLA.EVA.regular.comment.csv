It was stated today Danforth tossed a number of balls to the umpires himself so as to avoid suspicion that he might be doctoring the ball. (NYT reported more than a dozen balls were thrown out while NY was at bat, but none was marked in such a way as to indicating 'cheating' by the local sharpshooter.)  Danforth recently was suspended for alleged tampering with a ball in a game at Philadelphia.'"

It was stated today Danforth tossed a number of balls to the umpires himself so as to avoid suspicion that he might be doctoring the ball. (NYT reported more than a dozen balls were thrown out while NY was at bat, but none was marked in such a way as to indicating 'cheating' by the local sharpshooter.)

Danforth then examined it, tossed it to Collins for another inspection before it was returned to play. The unsportsmanlike conduct of the Detroit leader roused the resentment in the stands; the crowd panned him viciously as he walked to the bench."
"SLA192309010",43,"Cobb was again a target for a stormy uproar in the stands when he stepped to the plate.  Cobb was out on a fast play. The crowd gave way to riotous enthusiasm when the 'Georgia Peach' was called out."
