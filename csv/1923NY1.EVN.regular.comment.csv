"NY1192304260",0,"$In attendance: Commissioner Landis, Christy Mathewson, Mayor Hylan, Gov. Silzer and Sen. Edwards of New Jersey, John Heydler (NL pres.), John Tener (former NL pres.) Hylan threw out the first ball; Landis presented diamond rings to all the NY players, trophies of their world's championship victory of last October.  Ump McCormick was presented with a diamond-studded watch fob (he was one of the officials of the last World's Series). The Polo Grounds was still in the throes of construction. The upper grandstands were still unfinished and the old flag pole was missing, prompting the Giants to raise the flag atop a temporary staff on the roof directly behind home plate."
