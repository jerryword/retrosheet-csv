"CHA193906041",8,"$Note from 6/6/1939 Chi. Tribune: in the first inning of the first game Sunday [6/4/1939] Radcliff was credited with a scratch hit when with 2 strikes and a runner on 2B the ball apparently hit his bat and rolled slowly to P Pippen. [Now] it turns out Radcliff swung and missed. The pitch bounced in front of home plate, bounced off a shin guard, and rolled towards the mound. Under the revised ruling Rip loses his hit and Pippen is charged with an error."
