"MIN197004250",48,"$Tigers 3B coach Grover Resinger saw that Twins catcher Paul Ratliff trapped the pitch in the dirt, did not tag Wilson and rolled the ball to the mound; Resinger told Wilson to start running as most of the Twins entered the dugout; Wilson got to 1B easily and headed for 2B; since no one interfered with him, he started for 3B; by this time, Brant Alyea, who was trotting in from LF, heard Resinger shouting at Wilson; Alyea hustled to the mound but had trouble picking up the ball so Wilson headed for home where Twins Leo Cardenas and Ratliff had returned; Alyea finally picked up the ball and threw to Cardenas; Wilson turned back to 3B but was tagged out by Alyea for a K767; catcher Ratliff was charged with an error; after the game, Detroit catcher Bill Freehan said 'If Alyea had been hustling, Wilson might have made it home; Tell him to start coming in and off the field a little quicker.' Wilson pulled a hamstring muscle running the bases and had to come out","1970MIN.EVA.regular.comment.csv",8
