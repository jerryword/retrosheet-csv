"NYA192305040",49,"$Galloway drove into deep right for a ground hit.  Ruth tried to stop the ball before it bounded over the low fence, and the Babe fell over the fence turning a complete somersault. He was off the playing field entirely and while trying to regain his feet, Galloway ran all around the bases. However, the Babe got out in time and threw him out at the plate. The play resulted in a double casualty as Galloway injured his leg in sliding, and Ruth came in holding his left arm to his side and blotches of blood on his left hand.  The game was held up while Galloway's leg was taped and Ruth received first aid treatment on the bench."
