# retrosheet-csv
This repo contains parsed Retrosheet event data produced by Chadwick's CWGAME, CWEVENT, CWCOMMENT, CWSUB, and CWDAILY tools (ver. 0.8.1).
There are also two additional fields provided within `parse_rs_events.sh`: `FILENAME_TX` and `LINE_NUMBER_CT` to allow for traceback to the source CSV files.
