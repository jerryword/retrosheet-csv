"SFN200809260",47,"replay,6,molib001,SFN,welkt901,SFO03,O,Y,I,,H $Bengie Molina's fly ball hit a few feet to the left of the 'Splash Hits' sign in right field; Molina held at first while Pablo Sandoval ran from first to third; Giants manager Bruce Bochy had told Emmanuel Burriss to run for Molina if he got on base, so Burriss immediately popped out of the dugout and replaced Molina; then Omar Vizquel said he thought the ball hit the green metal awning along the right field wall, which is a home run; Bochy saw a baseball with green paint on it and went out to the field to show it to the umpires and asked them to discuss the play; crew chief Tim Welke decided to use the replay system and reversed the call from ball in play to home run; however, he would not allow the Giants to put Molina back in to run out his homer; Bochy protested the game, which became moot because the Giants won the contest; Molina was given credit for a home run and two RBI but no run scored; Burriss ran out the homer and was given credit for the run scored; when he returned to the dugout, Molina greeted him by saying 'Good Swing!'; the total delay was 12 minutes"
